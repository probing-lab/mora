    x**2  =  2*p*x + p + x**2
    x  =  p + x

 Solving for x^2  with initial condition x^2(0) = 0
 Solving for x^1  with initial condition x^1(0) = 0
    x^1(n)    ->  n*p
    x^2(n)    ->  n*p*(n*p - p + 1)
 Solution found
   x^2  =  n*p*(n*p - p + 1)
 Solution found
   x^1  =  n*p

Moment based invariants for program binomial, with invariants over [x**2]:
