    x  =  x + 1
    y  =  x**2 + 2*x + 2
    x**2  =  x**2 + 2*x + 2

 Solving for x^1  with initial condition x^1(0) = 0
    x^1(n)    ->  n
 Solution found
   x^1  =  n
 Solving for y^1  with initial condition y^1(0) = 1
 Solving for x^2  with initial condition x^2(0) = 0
    x^2(n)    ->  n*(n + 1)
    y^1(n)    ->  n*(n - 1) + 2*n
 Solution found
   y^1  =  n*(n - 1) + 2*n
 Solution found
   x^2  =  n*(n + 1)
